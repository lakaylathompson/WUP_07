### Introduction 

### Data is from the Patient_Info dataset from South Korea 1 Jan to 1 May 2020
### This data was retrieved from a downloadable zip file from kaggle

Some of the data was uncoded for sex - sex must be just male or female
77 of the data entries were coded sex  as blank, so we omit these.
state of a patient must be died or alive - we adjust that as well   
  
# Your Question - Is dying independent of sex?

$H_0$: There is no difference in COVID-19 mortality rates between males and females, the probability of dying is independent of sex.  

$H_A$: There is a difference in COVID-19 mortality rates between males and females, the probability of dying depends on sex.  


## Graphical results - use ggplot commands to do this  

Result is a categorical variable

Sex is also a categorical variable

result~sex, so we use the helper file cat~cat  

## Numerical results


## Inferential results 




## Conclusions
